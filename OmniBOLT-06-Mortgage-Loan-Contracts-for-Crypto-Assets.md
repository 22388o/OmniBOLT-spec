Following this simple rule, we can build the mortgage loan contract:

“
You deposit something valuable as mortgage in an escrow account, and I lend money to you according to a proper LTV(Loan to Value). If you repay the loan within agreed deadline, i will return your mortgage. If you don’t, your mortgage will be mine.
”
